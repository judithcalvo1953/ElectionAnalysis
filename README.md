## Challenge Overview
This challenge allowed us to expand our knowledge of important functionality in Python to analyze data and write reports automatically.
## Challenge Summary
This was an example of using .csv files as data sources and submitting them to Python for statistical analysis.  This challenge provided practice in key concepts:
  -Use of for loops and conditional statements
  -Use of modules to facilitate reading and writing files across various platforms.
  -Use of f-strings to make printing output easier to execute
